      "message": "I don\u0027t like that this is necessary since it is not very intuitive, but it seems to work: when a recording isn\u0027t already on-going and a silenced recording would be attempted, it doesn\u0027t count, but when a recording *is* on-going and an additional silenced recording is attempted, it does count. This is apparently the behavior the tests expect as far as accounting, and when adhering to it alongside the fw/av change with this Change-Id, the tests and the manually-observed privacy indicator + silenced audio state appear to be correct.\n\nSee https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_frameworks_av/+/427710/comments/a8663dc8_57bb2e12\n\nWill test on device a while.",
