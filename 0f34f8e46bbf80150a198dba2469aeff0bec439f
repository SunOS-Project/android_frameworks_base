In the AOSP commit 1d18955361236ad532e94dc6a31fb8eec58c124a, the line \u0027mOrientationListener.disable();\u0027 was also present in the previous/replaced code, but in our code, the line was removed in commit e6e5720dcebb992a28c117b0e153ff11301a3e42 \"Check orientation when retrieving FP location\", so we should not wrongly add it again.",
